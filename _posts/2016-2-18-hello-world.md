Say hello to Apiary Coding! We're a brand new online and Edinburgh based collaborative learning community, which aims to provide a a safe and welcoming environment for women and non-binary folk of all knowledge levels to improve their tech skills together. 

Like a lot of things, Apiary Coding was born out of frustration. I love to learn, and I always want to improve my coding skills and learn new languages. But I've been coding for a few years, so I'm too advanced for beginner's groups. The spaces you typically go to find help when you have some tech experience are notoriously unforgiving - especially if you're a woman. And while my university has a group for women who code, it's only for those studying Computer Science.

I decided to set up Apiary Coding so I'd have a space to learn with like-minded women and non-binary folk. While we've only just started, in the future we're hoping to run more accessible meet ups, create a bigger and better list of resources and be able to provide more structured support for newcomers to coding. We'd love it if you joined us on the journey! If you self-identify as a woman or non-binary gender(s), join our [Slack group](https://apiarycoding.slack.com). If you want to support the community and keep up with any news, everyone is welcome to like our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/apiarycoding/) and follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/apiarycoding). 

Now, let's get to it!
