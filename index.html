			<h2 id="about">About</h2>

			<p>Apiary Coding is a collaborative online and physical learning space for women and non-binary folk of all knowledge levels to learn tech skills together.</p>

			<p>We don't have any tutors or syllabus - we aim to provide a friendly, supportive community and help each other find the best resources to learn what we want to learn, how we want to learn it.</p>

			<h2>How it Works</h2>

				<p>Apiary Coding is open to everyone who identifies as a woman or non-binary gender(s) and wants to improve their tech skills.</p> 

				<p>You don't have to be a part of or want to join the tech industry. We believe everyone can benefit from learning a bit more about tech, whatever their aims, abilities or existing knowledge.</p>

				<h3>Online</h3>

				<p>Check out our list of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/resources">free learning resources</a> from across the web.</p>

				<p>Join our <a href="https://apiarycoding.slack.com">Slack group!</a> It's invitation-only, but invites are freely granted. Just email <a href="mailto:apiarycoding@gmail.com">apiarycoding@gmail.com</a> and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.</p>

				<p>In our Slack, you can chat and ask questions with fellow Apiary Coding learners. Just find a channel related to what you want to learn - or create one if it doesn't exist yet - and get talking!</p>

				<h3>At a Meet Up</h3>

				<p>We hold regular meet ups in central Edinburgh - you can <a href="#where-and-when">find out when and where our next meet up will be below.</a> Meet ups are open to all women/non-binary folk who'd like to attend - just bring along something you can learn on (preferably a laptop).</p>

				<p>Everyone at an Apiary Coding meet up wears a sticker with what they want to learn that day and what they can help others with</p>

				<img src="/images/hello.svg" alt="">

				<p>If you see someone with a similar skill on their sticker, say "Hi!"</p>

				<p>And learn together!</p>
