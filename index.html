			<p>Apiary Coding is a collaborative online and physical learning space for women and non-binary folk of all knowledge levels to learn tech skills together.</p>

			<p>We don't have any tutors or syllabus - our aim is to help each other learn what we want to learn, how we want to learn.</p>

				<img src="/images/identity1.svg" alt="">

				<p>Everyone at an Apiary Coding meet up wears a sticker with what they want to learn that day and what they can help others with</p>

				<img src="/images/hello.svg" alt="">

				<p>If you see someone with a similar skill on their sticker, say "Hi!"</p>

				<p>And let's learn together!</p>

			<p>Apiary Coding is committed to all atendees at our events having a safe and enjoyable experience and, as such, operates under a Safer Spaces Policy.</p>

			<p>By attending an event run by Apiary Coding, you agree to the following:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Apiary Coding events are open only to those who identify as a woman or non-binary gender/genders.</li>

				<li>However, how someone identifies isn't open for debate - harassment based on someone's percieved gender will not be tolerated.</li>

				<li>Indeed, Apiary Coding has zero tolerance for harassment - that is, behaviour that may make someone feel distressed, humiliated or threatened - of any kind, for any reason. This applies at all spaces run by or associated with Apiary Coding (both physical and online), as well as spaces outside our control.</li>

				<li>Apiary Coding expects atendees at its events to behave in a polite, courteous manner and respect the wishes of other atendees.</li>

				<li>Anyone found to be violating the Safer Spaces Policy will be removed and banned from Apiary Coding spaces indefinitely.</li>
			</ul>
